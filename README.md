# apartments-management-app-cpluss
This C++ Application Manages Ajax Apartments Inc. Residents and Activities.
This is one of my sample projects as a Computer Science student to enhance my software design skill.  
In this project, I designed and created a C++ application program that manages apartments residents and some office activities for a fictional company named Ajax Apartments Inc. that owns these apartments.
You can checkout my first project for the same company here: https://jfisher01.github.io/myweb/ , in which I designed a website for them using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
You can also view my third project with the same company in which I developed a Java application that manages staff information. View the project here: https://github.com/jfisher01/ajax-staff-manager-java
