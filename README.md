# apartments-management-app-cpluss
This is a patial project in C++ Application that Manages Ajax Apartments Inc. Residents and Activities.
This is a part of the major project I coded in Java to enhance my software design skill in C++ language.  
In this project, I designed and created a C++ application program that manages apartments residents and some office activities for a fictional company named Ajax Apartments Inc. that owns these apartments. This is a partial project to emphasize C++ knowledge.
You can view the main project with this company in my third project, in which I developed a complete Java application project that manages staff information and clients residents. View the project here: https://github.com/jfisher01/ajax-clients-staff-manager-java
You can checkout my first project for the same company here: https://jfisher01.github.io/myweb/ , in which I designed a website for them using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
